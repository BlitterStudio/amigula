Amiga Games UAE Launcher

AMI.G.U.LA. (Amiga Games UAE Launcher) is a Windows application
allowing you to manage and enjoy your Amiga games collection. 

You can scan for your games, add them in a library, search for them, 
view their screenshots, listen to their music and of course, 
launch them in WinUAE so you can play them!

Requirements
============
- Visual Studio 2013
- Reactive Extensions (Rx) package for VS

Since development has stalled on this project, I decided to make it
available to the public under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.
